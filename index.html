<p> Basic concepts utilize HTML language. This language uses symbols and phrases to create a digital work of art.</p>
<p> In the days before digital publishing, critics and authors alike were more anticipatory of their approach to the form. </p>

<p> Publishing is one of the fastest and most effective ways to achieve that end.  </p>
<p> It's where the creative process intersects with expression, and individuals can share. </p>

<h4> Practice Makes Perfect </h4>
<p> Challenging until one grasps the basic understanding and may become easy & effortless. </p>
